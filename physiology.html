                <p>Mechanical tension is the primary and, according to current research, the sole cause of muscle hypertrophy. Chris Beardsley, an expert in muscle physiology, explains: “Active mechanical tension (caused by muscular contractions) causes the addition of myofibrils, leading to an increase in muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Passive mechanical tension (caused by stretch) causes the addition of sarcomeres in series, leading to an increase in muscle fiber length.” This tension is applied to specific muscle fibers, and particular motor units are recruited to target high-threshold fibers in a process called motor unit recruitment. Motor units consist of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it controls, and recruitment follows the size principle, where smaller, low-threshold motor units are activated first, and as more force is required, larger, high-threshold motor units are recruited. So the harder the task (closer to muscular failure), the bigger the motor unit recruited..</p>

Biomechanics is “the scientific study of the mechanical laws relating to the movement or structure of living organisms,” which, in simpler terms, explains how the human body moves and interacts with forces in the real world. The field “defines how forces interact with the human body, from muscles and bones to ligaments and joints.” Biomechanics is extremely important to exercise science and muscle physiology because it directly explains muscle function, joint actions, torque, and force production based on the moment arms of the muscles and joints. Gym machinery is built using biomechanical engineering, with equipment designed to work with natural muscle function while targeting specific muscle fibers by altering resistance profiles and ranges of motion
